      I have been building software for a very long time. Not quite back to the
      days of punch cards, but I did write programs in BASIC on an Apple II
      (that was in high school) and with the first version of Turbo Pascal on a
      Compaq portable with dual floppy drives. While much of that is no longer
      directly relevant, it provided a foundation in algorithms and computing
      concepts that led to what eventually became the internet.

      I would like to think that much of what I have done in the last couple of
      decades is more practically useful. One benefit of growing older is
      gaining insight into both ourselves and others. That, along with general
      problem-solving skills, is probably the most valuable aspect of what I
      bring to the table. It is a kind of golden age now, where we have AI that
      can accelerate our work and fill in the gaps in our technical knowledge.
      More recently, I have been interested in or worked on areas such as:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-inside list-disc" role="list">
      <li>
        Using the latest AI models as programming aids. These tools enable
        inexperienced or non-technical individuals to create software quickly
        and inexpensively. They also allow experienced developers like me to
        build software faster than ever before—even with unfamiliar languages or
        technologies. These large language models and related systems are
        enabling entirely new features and functionality that were previously
        not feasible. We are already seeing this impact, and I expect much more
        in the near future.
      </li>
      <li>
        Building and operating a load testing platform called LoadStorm with my
        business partner. We spent about a decade developing and supporting this
        product, which many customers appreciated. Ultimately, we were not able
        to remain competitive in the space. However, I gained a great deal of
        experience in running a business and, in hindsight, identified
        strategies we could have pursued differently. I also acquired deep
        knowledge in optimizing websites for performance, scalability, and
        reliability.
      </li>
      <li>
        Being peripherally involved in paper manufacturing for many years. My
        father was a paper industry executive and eventually purchased (with
        partners) a recycled paper mill in the mountains of North Carolina. I
        served as a board member for Jackson Paper Manufacturing throughout its
        growth and expansion into two converting facilities. I gained exposure
        to a wide range of business functions—from boardroom strategy to sales,
        engineering, and factory operations. The company was sold a few years
        ago.
      </li>
      <li>
        Writing code and participating (unsuccessfully) in the ARC Challenge
        last year. My approach involved generative techniques and evolutionary
        algorithms implemented in C++. I am considering entering again this
        year, but may instead focus on more fruitful or practical projects.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="title mb-6">Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
      If you are curious or simply want to verify that I am (mostly) human, here
      are a few personal interests.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-inside list-disc" role="list">
      <li>
        I am happily married, with daughters, sons-in-law, and grandchildren.
        Grandparenting is a wonderful stage of life.
      </li>
      <li>
        My family and I are Christians and are actively involved in our church.
      </li>
      <li>
        I enjoy spending time outdoors and usually go hiking or jogging with my
        dog, Rio, in the desert near our home in Albuquerque.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am an avid cyclist. If you recognized the Strava link on the home
        page, you may have guessed this. Cycling, along with slower-paced
        running, rucking, and other workouts, helps me stay reasonably fit.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have been working on learning Spanish over the past few years. I took
        a small amount of Spanish in high school that did not stick, and while
        living in the southwestern United States gives me some exposure, it is
        still a humbling experience to learn a new language—especially for
        someone more comfortable with math and technology.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="title mb-6">About This Site</h2>
    <p>
      This site was created using a JAMstack tool called Astro, along with a
      theme by Artem Kutsan that I significantly simplified. It is deployed on
      GitHub using GitHub Pages.
